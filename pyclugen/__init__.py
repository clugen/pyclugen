"""Various functions for multidimensional cluster generation in Python.

Note that:

1. [`clugen()`][pyclugen.main.clugen] is the main function of the **pyclugen**
   package, and possibly the only function most users will need.
2. Functions which accept `rng` as the last parameter are stochastic. Thus, in
   order to obtain the same result on separate invocations of these functions,
   pass them an an instance of same pseudo-random number
   [`Generator`][numpy.random.Generator] initialized with the same seed.
