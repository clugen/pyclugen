    !!! Note
        In the descriptions below, the terms "average" and "dispersion" refer to
        measures of central tendency and statistical dispersion, respectively.
        Their exact meaning depends on several optional arguments.

    Args:
      num_dims: Number of dimensions.
      num_clusters: Number of clusters to generate.
      num_points: Total number of points to generate.
      direction: Average direction of the cluster-supporting lines. Can be a
        vector of length `num_dims` (same direction for all clusters) or a
        matrix of size `num_clusters` x `num_dims` (one direction per cluster).
      angle_disp: Angle dispersion of cluster-supporting lines (radians).
      cluster_sep: Average cluster separation in each dimension (vector of size
        `num_dims`).
      llength: Average length of cluster-supporting lines.
      llength_disp: Length dispersion of cluster-supporting lines.
      lateral_disp: Cluster lateral dispersion, i.e., dispersion of points from their
        projection on the cluster-supporting line.
      allow_empty: Allow empty clusters? `False` by default.
      cluster_offset: Offset to add to all cluster centers (vector of size `num_dims`).
        By default the offset will be equal to `numpy.zeros(num_dims)`.
      proj_dist_fn: Distribution of point projections along cluster-supporting lines,
        with three possible values:

        - `"norm"` (default): Distribute point projections along lines using a normal
          distribution (μ=_line center_, σ=`llength/6`).
        - `"unif"`: Distribute points uniformly along the line.
        - User-defined function, which accepts two parameters, line length (`float`),
          number of points (`int`) and an instance of
          [`Generator`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generator.html?highlight=generator#numpy.random.Generator),
          and returns an array containing the distance of each point projection to
          the center of the line. For example, the `"norm"` option roughly corresponds
          to `lambda l, n, rg: l * rg.random((n, 1)) / 6`.

      point_dist_fn: Controls how the final points are created from their projections
        on the cluster-supporting lines, with three possible values:

        - `"n-1"` (default): Final points are placed on a hyperplane orthogonal to
          the cluster-supporting line, centered at each point's projection, using the
          normal distribution (μ=0, σ=`lateral_disp`). This is done by the
          [`clupoints_n_1()`][pyclugen.module.clupoints_n_1] function.
        - `"n"`: Final points are placed around their projection on the
          cluster-supporting line using the normal distribution (μ=0,
          σ=`lateral_disp`). This is done by the
          [`clupoints_n()`][pyclugen.module.clupoints_n] function.
        - User-defined function: The user can specify a custom point placement
          strategy by passing a function with the same signature as
          [`clupoints_n_1()`][pyclugen.module.clupoints_n_1] and
          [`clupoints_n()`][pyclugen.module.clupoints_n].

      clusizes_fn: Distribution of cluster sizes. By default, cluster sizes are
        determined by the [`clusizes()`][pyclugen.module.clusizes] function, which
        uses the normal distribution (μ=`num_points`/`num_clusters`, σ=μ/3), and
        assures that the final cluster sizes add up to `num_points`. This parameter
        allows the user to specify a custom function for this purpose, which must
        follow [`clusizes()`][pyclugen.module.clusizes] signature. Note that custom
        functions are not required to strictly obey the `num_points` parameter.
        Alternatively, the user can specify an array of cluster sizes directly.
      clucenters_fn: Distribution of cluster centers. By default, cluster centers
        are determined by the [`clucenters()`][pyclugen.module.clucenters] function,
        which uses the uniform distribution, and takes into account the `num_clusters`
        and `cluster_sep` parameters for generating well-distributed cluster centers.
        This parameter allows the user to specify a custom function for this purpose,
        which must follow [`clucenters()`][pyclugen.module.clucenters] signature.
        Alternatively, the user can specify a matrix of size `num_clusters` x
        `num_dims` with the exact cluster centers.
      llengths_fn: Distribution of line lengths. By default, the lengths of
        cluster-supporting lines are determined by the
        [`llengths()`][pyclugen.module.llengths] function, which uses the folded
        normal distribution (μ=`llength`, σ=`llength_disp`). This parameter allows
        the user to specify a custom function for this purpose, which must follow
        [`llengths()`][pyclugen.module.llengths] signature. Alternatively, the user
        can specify an array of line lengths directly.
      angle_deltas_fn: Distribution of line angle differences with respect to
        `direction`. By default, the angles between `direction` and the direction of
        cluster-supporting lines are determined by the
        [`angle_deltas()`][pyclugen.module.angle_deltas] function, which uses the
        wrapped normal distribution (μ=0, σ=`angle_disp`) with support in the interval
        [-π/2, π/2]. This parameter allows the user to specify a custom function for
        this purpose, which must follow [`angle_deltas()`][pyclugen.module.angle_deltas]
        signature. Alternatively, the user can specify an array of angle deltas
        directly.
      rng: An optional instance of [`Generator`][numpy.random.Generator] for
        reproducible executions.

    Returns:
      The generated clusters and associated information in the form of a
        [`Clusters`][pyclugen.main.Clusters] object.

    the fields to be merged, and will have a common supertype.

    The `clusters_field` parameter specifies a field containing integers that
    identify the cluster to which the respective points belongs to. If
    `clusters_field` is specified (by default it's specified as `"clusters"`),
    cluster assignments in individual datasets will be updated in the merged
    dataset so that clusters are considered separate. This parameter can be set
    to `None`, in which case no field will be considered as a special cluster
    assignments field.

    This function can be used to merge data sets generated with the
    [`clugen()`][pyclugen.main.clugen] function, by default merging the
    `points` and `clusters` fields in those data sets. It also works with
    arbitrary data by specifying alternative fields in the `fields` parameter.
    It can be used, for example, to merge third-party data with
    [`clugen()`][pyclugen.main.clugen]-generated data.

    Examples:
        >>> from pyclugen import clugen, clumerge
        >>> data1 = clugen(2, 5, 1000, [1, 1], 0.01, [20, 20], 14, 1.2, 1.5);
        >>> data2 = clugen(2, 3, 450, [0.8, -0.3], 0, [25, 21], 6, 0.4, 3.5);
        >>> data3 = clugen(2, 2, 600, [0, -0.7], 0.2, [15, 10], 1, 0.1, 5.2);
        >>> data_merged = clumerge(data1, data2, data3)

    Args:
      *data: One or more cluster data sets whose `fields` are to be merged.
      fields: Fields to be merged, which must exist in the data set given in
        `*data`.
      clusters_field: Field containing the integer cluster labels. If specified,
        cluster assignments in individual datasets will be updated in the merged
        dataset so that clusters are considered separate.

    Returns:
      A dictionary, where keys correspond to field names, and values to the
        merged numerical arrays.
